# Radio App in 3 Page

Hii, I made this application where I used
[radio API](https://fr1.api.radio-browser.info/json/stations) to fetch all station and. And I displayed data on my application.

## body page

library to fetch data. After fetching the data I used a CONTEXT API to maintain given data to particular component(body component).

I displayed image of station. And some station doesn't contain image then i used [dummyImage](https://picsum.photos/id/$4/200/300) to display some dummy image.

## discription page.

This page will tell about station. What is the name of station and Where does it situated.

## Filter by country, state, name, tag (search page).

Here I have added a small input field that will filter on the basis of country, state and name.

## Library I used for this build?

I used a library called [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package//axios) to get radio station information.

## JS concept implemented.

     1) async/await
     2) ContextAPI
     3) localStorage
     4) Function Programming.
